## Augmented Reality and Geometry-Based Physical Stability Properties

### Abstract: 

{:.message}

  > In this paper, we present a novel approach by using simple additive manufacturing techniques for model stabilization to help with sculpture conservation. We also integrate Augmented Reality (AR) technology to enable more intuitive user-interaction and visualization, and our platform can be installed on any AR-enabled device, which would allow professionals to work with sculptures. Our platform con- structs mesh of different types of support structures in real-time subjected to user-specified preferences ready to be 3D printed and attached to the object of interest for added stability. We demonstrate that the 3D-printed support structure generated by our model provides the sufficient stability but is a lot faster, cheaper, and more convenient than the state-of-the-art system.
