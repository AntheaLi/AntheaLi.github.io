## Revisiting Image-Language Embeddings for Open-ended Phrase Detection

### Abstract: 

{:.message}

  >We define a new task of open vocabulary phrase detection by incorporating zero and one shot detection. We adapt Faster-RCNN to perform element-wise product of the text embedding and the region features to input into the bounding box regression layer. Initialize the classification layer with CCA (canonical correlation analysis) help with performance. (in submission to ACL)
