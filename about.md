# About Me

I am a master student studying Computer Science at Stanford. I am interested in Computer Graphics and Computer Vision research, especially in the 3D content generation realm.

Before coming to Stanford, I received my Bachelors with the Summa Cum Laude Honor in Computer Science, Mathematics, and Economics at Boston University as well as the College Prize for Excellence in Computer Science. I was fortunate to get into Computational Geometry based research at the Shape Lab supervised by Professor Emily Whiting. I was also very lucky having been able to work along side many inspiring researchers specializing in various fields including Computer Vision, specifically image-level domain adaptation, as well as Natural Language Processing, specifically vision-language grounding.

I have multiple years of experiences working with 3D environments in visual effects production. In the future, I wish to bring my insights and experiences from computational geometry and image-level vision tasks to intelligent 3D content creation and motion generation.
