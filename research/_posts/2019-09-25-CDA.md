## Abstract: 

In this paper, we define the problem of online variational transfer learning as continuous  domain  adaptation (CDA) and make three major contributions addressing this new task. First, we collect and annotate a large scale  cross-domain  recognition  dataset  for  continuous  domain adaptation, named WeatherDA. Second, we propose a novel end-to-end deep learning approach, Domain Adaptation with Disentangled Prototype(DADP), which aims to transfer knowledge learned from labeled  source  domains  to  a  sequence  of  target  domains  by aligning the prototypes of disentangled domain-invariant features. Third, we propose to utilize a light-weight memory to handle the problem of catastrophic forgetting. In submission.
