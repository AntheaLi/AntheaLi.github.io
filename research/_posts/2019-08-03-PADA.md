## Learning Domain Adaptive Features with Unlabeled Domain Bridges

### Abstract: 

{:.message}

  >In this paper, we propose a novel approach to learn domain adaptive features between the largely-gapped source and targetdomains with unlabeled domain bridges. Firstly, we introduce the framework of Cycle-consistency Flow Generative Adversarial Networks (CFGAN) that utilizes domain bridges to perform image-to-image translation between two distantly distributed domains. Secondly, we propose the Prototypical Adversarial Domain Adaptation (PADA) model which utilizes unlabeled bridge domains to align feature distribution between source and target with large discrepancy. In submission.
